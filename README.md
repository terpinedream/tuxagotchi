# tuxagotchi
**Tuxagotchi is a TUI based tomagotchi-like pet that lives in your terminal.**

***"Feed" Tux by pushing your code to a specified repo***
****Happy = 4 hrs****
****Neutral = 2 hrs****
****Sad = 1 hrs****
****Dead = just push the code, man****

***Currently using rich for rendering***

**ASSETS |**
***Stores the different ASCII art stages for Tux.***
***xxx2.txt holds a duplicate file with an additional line of padding on the top.***
***This is used to give the illusion of animations.***

**CONFIG.TOML |**
***Holds credentials.**
***Username + Repo name.***

**GITHUB.PY |**
***Handles GitHub API interactions.***

**TUX.PY |**
***Holds functions for Tux's moods.***

**TUXAGOTCHI.PY |**
***Loads config & holds main() function.***
***Checks for new commits and "animates" Tux via tick.***
****Please note in line 28, the CHECK_INTERVAL NEEDS to be 60s.****
****This is to prevent you from hitting the API request limit.****
****Which would instantly kill Tux :(.****

**UI.PY |**
***Renders the TUI.***
***Uses rich for rendering.***
***If I can get better ASCII art/animations I will likely switch to Textual.***

*EDIT AUG 4th, 2025:*
**Thank you thank you thank you for all the support! I am currently looking into switching to textual for rendering so I can add some more fun stuff for you guys. Stay tuned!**
